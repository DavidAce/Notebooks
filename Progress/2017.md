# 2017

## Half of January

* Started on exact diagonalization of the quantum Ising spin model, using C++ with the Eigen math-library
* Started Many Particle Physics course

## February

* Worked with Many Particle Physics HW problems.
* Started a new course: FSI3000 History of physics and epistemology, 5 hp.
* Review of entanglement and entanglement measures
* Continued work on exact diagonalization. See [dropbox paper](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Exact-Diagonalization-Zs6dbUNX7xyvmrUqgLzBt).
* Learned about different software for diagonalization in C++. Nice find: [Spectra](https://github.com/yixuan/spectra). Main takeaway: large matrices are really slow to diagonalize, one is basically limited just a few eigenvalues (largest/smallest algebraic or absolute values), and even then it becomes intractable.

## March

* Last work on Many Particle physics HW problems and its final presentation. Got an A! Yay! Incidentally, the last HW, a presentation-problem, was about the analytic solution to the quantum Ising spin model.
* Finished the review of entanglement by doing some exercies See [dropbox paper](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Entanglement-27fQY5yNn6Lsrcm5LRFB0). 
* More serious look at Schollwöck's paper. Tried to grasp the notation and possible implementation of  Schmidt decomposition. 
* Tried doing minimal examples of successive Schmidt decompositions by hand, with two or three "bit"-particles. Confusion ensued. The explanations by Pollman's and Schollwöck lack some intermediate steps or are unclear, for what happens between each Schmidt-iteration. [See GitHub paper](https://stackedit.io/viewer#!url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavidAce/Notebooks/master/MPS/MPS.md). (It probably has some errors)
* Explored note-taking software. Result: Markdown+Latex (Mathjax/Katex) works great. Math can be copy-pasted into latex if needed. Dropbox paper has a limited version of this. Better to use Typora, ReText or StackEdit (online). Tried Jupyter briefly but I don't think it's the correct tool yet. Another promising programming notebook: [Beaker](http://beakernotebook.com/), if it could only just work... check in the future.

## April

* Looked at other software packages to see if I could reproduce results from these. [ITensor](http://itensor.org/) stood out, but it is kind of slow according to Jens. Still, it is good to keep around to compare results and get hints on implementation.
* Started to implement a simplest case scenario of MPS decompositon. Basically this step:
$$
\begin{aligned}
c_{\sigma_1,\sigma_2...\sigma_n}  = \sum_{a_1,a_2...a_{n-1}} A^{\sigma_1}_{a_1}A^{\sigma_2}_{a_1,a_2}...A^{\sigma_n}_{a_{n-1}}
\end{aligned}
$$
​	for an arbitrary tensor $c$. As usual this is done in C++ with the Eigen's math library.
* A discussion with Jens sorted out the confusion I had about " tensor flattening". Also, between successive Schmidt decompositions the resulting matrices from the SVD need to be interpreted as tensors properly. Before continuing to the next step. This was the missing piece.


## May

* Prepared a presentation for the course FSI3000
* [Found a great book that clarified a lot](http://www.springer.com/in/book/9783319142517). Basically I want the Vidal Canonical form $\Gamma \Lambda \Gamma \Lambda...$ so I can get any $A$ (left-canonical) or $B$ (right-canonical) form later.  
* Succeeded in correctly interpreting $U$ and $V$ matrices as tensors after each SVD.
* Small victory: Truncating the SVD down to $\chi$ was quite simple. 
* After correctly understanding storage orders and a related bug with RowMajor in Eigen's implementation of SVD, all my problems were gone. The MPS decomposition is finally correct for an arbitrary tensor state. 
* Checked out the Julia programming language for. **If C++ becomes too cumbersome, Julia is a good option!!**
* Nice find: [RedSVD](https://code.google.com/archive/p/redsvd/) can do SVD quickly on huge matrices using a randomized algorithm.
* Started working on implementing TEBD. [Pollmann's](http://quantumtensor.pks.mpg.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/notes_1.pdf) paper is great at explaining this conceptually. I am mainly copying to C++ the steps in itebd.py by Jens and Frank Pollmann, while checking the steps in the paper.
* Somewhat distracted by the last solid mechanics exam.


## June

# Current short-term goals

* Finish the iTEBD algorithm
* Try another Hamiltonian
* Try measuring other observables
* Compare performance and precision using [RedSVD](https://code.google.com/archive/p/redsvd/), and check how it scales with larger $\chi$
* Start with DMRG.
